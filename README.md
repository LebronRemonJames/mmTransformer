# Official Implementation of mmTransformer:
- Multimodal Motion Prediction with Stacked Transformers. (CVPR 2021) [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.11624.pdf)] [[Webpage](https://decisionforce.github.io/mmTransformer/)]
- Since the code is still waiting for release, if you have any question with reproduction, feel free to contact us. We will try our best to help you.
- Currently, the core code of mmTransformer is implemented in the commercial project of Sensetime. We are trying our best to make the code publicly available.
- For data preprocessing of Argoverse Dataset, you can refer to our [[preprocessing repository](https://github.com/jzhang538/Argoverse-Data-Preprocess)] to get correct input format.
